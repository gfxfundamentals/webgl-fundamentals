WebGL Fundamentals
==================

This is [a series of lessons or tutorials about WebGL](http://webglfundamentals.org/).

Unlike most WebGL lessons these are not based off of OpenGL.
OpenGL is 20 years old. The lessons of OpenGL don't match well with WebGL.
The APIs have changed too much. The ideas of OpenGL and OpenGL tutorials
are out of date with WebGL, OpenGL ES 2.0 and the land of shaders.

I would argue that WebGL is actually a very simple API. What makes it
appear complicated is the way in which it's used. The complications
are added by the programmer. WebGL itself is simple.

These lessons try to show that simplicity and well as teach the
fundamentals of 2D math and 3D math so readers can hopefully
have an easier time writing their own WebGL programs and
understanding the complexity that other programmers pile on
top of simple WebGL.

This is work in progress. Feel free to contribute.

## Contributing

Of course bug fixes are always welcome.

If you'd like to write a new article please try to always take
one step at a time. Don't do 2 or more things in a single step.
Explain any new math in the simplest terms possible. Ideally
with diagrams where possible.
