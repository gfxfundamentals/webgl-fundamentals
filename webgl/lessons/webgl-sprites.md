Title: WebGL Sprites
Description: How to do sprites in WebGL
TOC: Sprites

This article for now is just a place holder.

Sprites have arguably already been covered, they just weren't called "sprites".

The article on sprites is [the article on how to draw
text with textures](webgl-text-texture.html). Replace the
text images with sprite images and you have sprites.

A related article on is [the article on reproducing
canvas 2D's `drawImage` function in WebGL](webgl-2d-drawimage.html) and the following
article on [matrix stacks](webgl-2d-matrix-stack.html)

Together those articles mostly cover sprites in WebGL.
If you have other things you want covered consider
