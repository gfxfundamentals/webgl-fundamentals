This article is about various precision issues in WebGL

## `lowp`, `mediump`, `highp`

In [the first article on this site](webgl-fundamentals.html) we created
a vertex shader and a fragment shader. When we created the fragment
shader it was mentioned almost in passing that a fragment shader
doesn't have a default precision and so we needed to set one by adding
the line

```glsl
precision mediump float;
```

What the heck was that about?

`lowp`, `mediump`, and `highp` are precision settings. Precision in this case
effectively means how many bits are used to store a value. A number in
Javascript uses 64bits. Most numbers in WebGL are only 32bits. Less bits =
faster, more bits = more accurate and/or larger range.

I don't know if I can explain this well. You can search for [double vs float](https://www.google.com/search?q=double+vs+float) for other examples of
precision issues but one way to explain it is like the difference between a byte and a short or in JavaScript a `Uint8Array` vs a `Uint16Array`.

* A `Uint8Array` is an array of unsigned 8bit integers. 8bits can hold 2<sup>8</sup> values from 0 to 255.
* A `Uint16Array` is an array of unsigned 16bit integers. 16bits can hold 2<sup>16</sup> values from 0 to 65535.
* A `Uint32Array` is an array of unsigned 32bit integers. 32bits can hold 2<sup>32</sup> values from 0 to 4294967295.

`lowp`, `mediump`, and `highp` are similar.

* `lowp` is at least an 9 bit value. For floating point values they can range from: -2 to +2, for integer values they are similar to `Uint8Array` or `Int8Array`
* `mediump` is at least a 16 bit value. For floating point values they can range from: -2<sup>14</sup> to +2<sup>14</sup>, for integer values they are similar to `Uint16Array` or `Int16Array`
* `highp` is at least a 32 bit value. For floating point values they can range from: -2<sup>62</sup> to +2<sup>62</sup>, for integer values they are similar to `Uint32Array` or `Int32Array`

It's important to note that not every value inside the range can be represented.
The easiest to understand is probably `lowp`. There are only 9 bits and so only
512 unique values can be represented. Above it says the range is -2 to +2 but
there are an infinite number of values between -2 and +2. For example 1.9999999
and 1.999998 are 2 values between -2 and +2. With only 9 bits `lowp` can't
represent those 2 values. So for example, if you want do some math on color and
you used `lowp` you might see a some banding. Without actually digging into what
actual values can be represented, we know colors go from 0 to 1. Is if `lowp`
goes from -2 to +2 and can only represent 512 unique values then it seems likely
only 128 of those values fit between 0 and 1. That would also suggest if you have
a value that is 4/128ths and I try to add 1/512th to it, nothing will happen
because 1/512th can't be represented by `lowp` so it's effectively 0.

Ideally we could just use `highp` everywhere and ignore this issue completely but
unfortunately that's not reality. There are 2 issues.

1. Some devices, mostly older or cheaper smartphones do not support `highp` in fragment shaders.

   This is problem if you declare your fragment shader to use `highp` and a user
   tries to load your page on a device that doesn't support `highp` the shader
   will fail to compile.

   Conversely, `mediump` which can be used everywhere, is often not high enough
   resolution for common things, for example 
   [point lights](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html).

2. On devices that do actually use 9 bits for `lowp` and/or 16bits for `mediump` they are usually faster than `highp`. Often significantly faster.

To that last point, unlike values in a `Uint8Array` or `Uint16Array`, a `lowp`
or `mediump` value or for that matter even a `highp` value is allowed to use
higher precision (more bits). So for example on a desktop GPU if you put
`mediump` in your shader it will still most likely use 32bits internally. This
has the problem of making it hard to test your shaders. To see if the your
shaders actually work correctly with `lowp` or `mediump` you have to test on a
device that actually uses 8bits for `lowp` and 16bits for `highp`.

So, what do you do?

Well one is you could just use `highp` and not worry about it. Users that have
devices that don't support `highp` might not be your target audience anyway
as maybe the have older slower devices that can't run your page well.

Another easy thing you can do is default to `highp` but fallback to `mediump`
if the device doesn't support `highp`. You can do that using the `GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH` preprocessor macro in your fragment shaders.

```glsl
// some fragment shader
#ifdef GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH
  precision highp float;
#else
  precision mediump float;
#endif

...
```

Now your shader will compile even if on a device that doesn't support `highp`
though it might get strange rendering artifacts depending on the contents of the shader.

Another option is you can try to write your fragment shaders to only need `mediump`.
You need to test on a device that actually supports true `mediump` to make sure
you actually succeeded.

Yet another option is to use different shaders if the device only supports
`mediump`. I mentioned above point lights can be an issue in `mediump`. This
is because [point lights](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html), in particular the specular highlight calculation, passes values in world or view space to the fragment shader,
those values can easily get out of range for a `mediump` value. So, maybe on
a `mediump` device you just leave out the specular highlights. For example here
is the point light shader from [the article on point lights](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html) modified to remove the highlight if the
device only supports `mediump`.

```glsl
#ifdef GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH
  precision highp float;
#else
  precision mediump float;
#endif

// Passed in from the vertex shader.
varying vec3 v_normal;
varying vec3 v_surfaceToLight;
varying vec3 v_surfaceToView;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform float u_shininess;

void main() {
  // because v_normal is a varying it's interpolated
  // so it will not be a unit vector. Normalizing it
  // will make it a unit vector again
  vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

  vec3 surfaceToLightDirection = normalize(v_surfaceToLight);
  float light = dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);

  gl_FragColor = u_color;

  // Lets multiply just the color portion (not the alpha)
  // by the light
  gl_FragColor.rgb *= light;

#ifdef GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH
  vec3 surfaceToViewDirection = normalize(v_surfaceToView);
  vec3 halfVector = normalize(surfaceToLightDirection + surfaceToViewDirection);

  float specular = 0.0;
  if (light > 0.0) {
    specular = pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess);
  }

  // Just add in the specular
  gl_FragColor.rgb += specular;
#endif
}
```

Note: Even that is not really enough. In the vertex shader we have

```glsl
  // compute the vector of the surface to the light
  // and pass it to the fragment shader
  v_surfaceToLight = u_lightWorldPosition - surfaceWorldPosition;
```

So let's say the light is 1000 units away from the surface.
We then get to the fragment shader and this line

```glsl
  vec3 surfaceToLightDirection = normalize(v_surfaceToLight);
```

seems innocent enough. Except that the normal way to normalize vector
is to divide by its length and the normal way to compute a length is

```
  float length = sqrt(v.x * v.x + v.y * v.y * v.z * v.z);
```

If one of those x, y, or z is 1000 then 1000*1000 is 1000000. 1000000
is out of range for `mediump`.

One solution here is to normalize in the vertex shader.

```
  // compute the vector of the surface to the light
  // and pass it to the fragment shader
#ifdef GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH
  v_surfaceToLight = u_lightWorldPosition - surfaceWorldPosition;
#else
  v_surfaceToLight = normalize(u_lightWorldPosition - surfaceWorldPosition);
#endif
```

Now the values assigned to `v_surfaceToLight` are between -1 and +1 which
is in range for `mediump`.

Note that normalizing in the vertex shader will not actually give the
same results but they might be close enough that no one will notice
unless compared side by side.

Functions like `normalize`, `length`, `distance`, `dot` all have this
issue that if the values are too large they're going to go out of range
for `mediump`.

Most of the above is about just making sure your app works on
devices that don't support `highp`. 

Another reason to care about these features is speed. Even though
you can use `highp` on most relatively modern smartphones, `mediump`
will run faster. Note again, this is only true if the device actually
supports lower precision `mediump`. If the device chose to use the
same precision for `mediump` as `highp` like most desktops do then
there will be no difference in speed but if you're wondering why your
app is slow on mobile and you've ruled out other things you might
try using `mediump` even on a device that supports `highp`. In fact
without all the stuff above you can just set your shader to use `mediump`
and see if your app runs faster on mobile. If it does then fix any
rendering issues. If it doesn't then maybe there is no reason to bother.

## Detecting support for `highp` and the precision of `mediump`

This is supposed to be relatively easy. You call `gl.getShaderPrecisionFormat`,
you pass in the shader type, `VERTEX_SHADER` or `FRAGMENT_SHADER` and you
pass in one of `LOW_FLOAT`, `MEDIUM_FLOAT`, `HIGH_FLOAT`,
`LOW_INT`, `MEDIUM_INT`, `HIGH_INT`, and it
[returns the precision info](../webgl-precision-lowp-mediump-highp.html).

Unfortunately Safari has a bug here which means checking this way will fail on iPhone, at least as of April 2020.

So, to check if a device supports `highp` at all you can just create
a fragment shader that uses `highp`, compile it, link it, and check for errors.
If it fails then `highp` is not supported. Note that you must link it with
a vertex shader. The spec does not require compiling to return errors as long
as those errors are caught at link time so just compiling a shader and
checking the `COMPILE_STATUS` is not sufficient to know if compiling actually
succeeded or failed. You must link and check the `LINK_STATUS`.

To check if `mediump` is really medium precision and not high precision
you'll have to do a render test. Basically you create a shader that uses
`mediump` and that does some math that will work in `highp` but fail in `mediump` then check the result. If the result is correct then that driver/gpu/device
uses `highp` for `mediump`. If the result is incorrect then `mediump` is
actually `mediump`.

Here is an example for checking if the fragment shader's `mediump` is really
`mediump`

More minutia: There is actually no guarantee that `lowp` is 9 bits,
`mediump` is 16 bits, and `highp` is 32 bits. All the spec says is that is
the minimum each can be. It could be `lowp` is 10 bits for example which would
still satisfy the spec (10 >= 9) and still be faster than `mediump` and so
still have a point. That said, AFAICT any device that actually supports `lowp`
as `lowp` uses 9 bits and any device that actually supports `mediump` uses
16bits. 

While my iPhone6+ from 2014 uses 16 bits for `mediump` it also uses 16 bits
for `lowp`. I'm not sure I've ever used a device that uses 9 bits for `lowp`
so I'm not sure what issues commonly come up if any.

Throughout these articles we've specified a default precision
in the fragment shader. We can also specify the precision of any individual
variable. For example

```glsl
uniform mediump vec4 color;  // a uniform
attribute lowp vec4 normal;  // an attribute
varying lowp vec4 texcoord;  // a varying
lowp float foo;              // a variable
```

## Canvas Precision Issues

The spec allows a canvas to be 16 bits instead of 32.

You can check by calling 

```
const bitsInCanvas =
    gl.getParameter(gl.RED_BITS) +
    gl.getParameter(gl.GREEN_BITS) +
    gl.getParameter(gl.BLUE_BITS) +
    gl.getParameter(gl.ALPHA_BITS);
```

Note that this actually returns the bit depths of the channels in the
currently bound framebuffer color attachment or the canvas if no
framebuffer is attached.

{{{example url="../webgl-precision-check-canvas-bits.html"}}}

Note: I don't actually know if any browsers on any devices use a 16 bit canvas
in 2020. I do know back when WebGL shipped in 2011 that Firefox at least
experimented with 16bit canvases to try to gain speed on mobile devices.
This is generally something you can ignore except if you are reading the
pixels out of the canvas for something other than images. Also, even if
the canvas is 16 bits you can still create 32bit render targets ([textures
attached to framebuffers](webgl-render-to-texture.html)).

## Texture Formats

Textures are another place where the spec says the actual precision
used can be greater than the precision requested.

As an example you can ask for 16 bit, 4bits per channel texture like this

```
gl.texImage2D(
  gl.TEXTURE_2D,               // target
  0,                           // mip level
  gl.RGBA,                     // internal format
  width,                       // width
  height,                      // height
  0,                           // border
  gl.RGBA,                     // format
  gl.UNSIGNED_SHORT_4_4_4_4,   // type
  null,
);
```

But the implementation might actually use a higher resolution format internally.
I believe most desktops do this and most mobile GPUs do not.

We can test. First we'll request a 4bit per channel texture like above.
Then we'll [render to it](webgl-render-to-texture.html) by rendering
some 0 to 1 gradient.

We'll then render that texture to the canvas. If the texture really is 4 bits
per channel internally there will only be 16 levels of color from the gradient
we drew. If the texture is really 8bits per channel we'll see 256 levels of
colors.

{{{example url="../webgl-precision-textures.html"}}}

Running it on my smartphone I see the texture is using 4bits per channel
(or at least 4 bits in red since I didn't test the other channels).

<div class="webgl_center"><img src="resources/mobile-4-4-4-4-texture-no-dither.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 600px;"></div>

Where as on my desktop I can see the texture is actually using 8bits per
channel even though I only asked for 4.

<div class="webgl_center"><img src="resources/desktop-4-4-4-4-texture-no-dither.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 600px;"></div>

One thing to note is that by default WebGL can dither its results to make
gradations like this look smoother. You can turn off dithering with

```js
gl.disable(gl.DITHER);
```

If I don't turn off dithering then my smartphone produces this.

<div class="webgl_center"><img src="resources/mobile-4-4-4-4-texture-dither.png" style="image-rendering: pixelated; width: 600px;"></div>

Off the top of my head the only place this would really come up is if you
used some lower bit resolution format texture as a render target and didn't
test on a device where that texture is actually that lower resolution.
If you only tested on desktop any issues it cause might not be apparent.
