Title: WebGL 2D Scale
Description: How to scale in 2D

This post is a continuation of a series of posts about WebGL.  The first
[started with fundamentals](webgl-fundamentals.html) and the previous was
[about rotating geometry](webgl-2d-rotation.html).

Scaling is just as [easy as translation](webgl-2d-translation.html).

We multiply the position by our desired scale.  Here are the changes from
our [previous sample](webgl-2d-rotation.html).

```
<script id="2d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex">
attribute vec2 a_position;

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_translation;
uniform vec2 u_rotation;
+uniform vec2 u_scale;

void main() {
+  // Scale the positon
+  vec2 scaledPosition = a_position * u_scale;

  // Rotate the position
  vec2 rotatedPosition = vec2(
*     scaledPosition.x * u_rotation.y + scaledPosition.y * u_rotation.x,
*     scaledPosition.y * u_rotation.y - scaledPosition.x * u_rotation.x);

  // Add in the translation.
  vec2 position = rotatedPosition + u_translation;
```

and we add the JavaScript needed to set the scale when we draw.

```
  ...

+  var scaleLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_scale");

  ...

+  var scale = [1, 1];

  ...

  // Draw the scene.
  function drawScene() {

    ...

    // Set the translation.
    gl.uniform2fv(translationLocation, translation);

    // Set the rotation.
    gl.uniform2fv(rotationLocation, rotation);

+    // Set the scale.
+    gl.uniform2fv(scaleLocation, scale);

    // Draw the geometry.
    var primitiveType = gl.TRIANGLES;
    var offset = 0;
    var count = 18;  // 6 triangles in the 'F', 3 points per triangle
    gl.drawArrays(primitiveType, offset, count);
  }
```

And now we have scale. Drag the sliders.

One thing to notice is that scaling by a negative value flips our
geometry.

I hope these last 3 posts were helpful in understanding
[translation](webgl-2d-translation.html),
[rotation](webgl-2d-rotation.html) and scale.  Next we'll go over [the
magic that is matrices](webgl-2d-matrices.html) that combines all 3 of
these into a much simpler and often more useful form.

<div class="webgl_bottombar">
<h3>Why an 'F'?</h3>
<p>
The first time I saw someone use an 'F' was on a texture.  The 'F' itself
is not important.  What is important is that you can tell its orientation
from any direction.  If we used a heart ❤ or a triangle △ for example we
couldn't tell if it was flipped horizontally.  A circle ○ would be even
worse.  A colored rectangle would arguably work with different colors on
each corner but then you'd have to remember which corner was which.  An
F's orientation is instantly recognizable.

Any shape that you can tell the orientation of would work, I've just used
'F' ever since I was 'F'irst introduced to the idea.
