Title: WebGL 2D Scale
Description: How to scale in 2D

This post is a continuation of a series of posts about WebGL. The first <a href="webgl-fundamentals.html">started with fundamentals</a> and the previous was <a href="webgl-2d-rotation.html">about rotating geometry</a>.

Scaling is just as <a href="webgl-2d-translation.html">easy as translation</a>.
<!--more-->
We multiply the position by our desired scale. Here are the changes from our <a href="webgl-2d-rotation.html">previous sample</a>.

<pre class="prettyprint showlinemods">
&lt;script id="2d-vertex-shader" type="x-shader/x-vertex"&gt;
attribute vec2 a_position;

uniform vec2 u_resolution;
uniform vec2 u_translation;
uniform vec2 u_rotation;
uniform vec2 u_scale;

void main() {
  // Scale the positon
  vec2 scaledPosition = a_position * u_scale;

  // Rotate the position
  vec2 rotatedPosition = vec2(
     scaledPosition.x * u_rotation.y + scaledPosition.y * u_rotation.x,
     scaledPosition.y * u_rotation.y - scaledPosition.x * u_rotation.x);

  // Add in the translation.
  vec2 position = rotatedPosition + u_translation;
</pre>

and we add the JavaScript needed to set the scale when we draw.

<pre class="prettyprint showlinemods">
  ...
  var scaleLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_scale");
  ...
  var scale = [1, 1];
  ...
  // Draw the scene.
  function drawScene() {
    // Clear the canvas.
    gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Set the translation.
    gl.uniform2fv(translationLocation, translation);

    // Set the rotation.
    gl.uniform2fv(rotationLocation, rotation);

    // Set the scale.
    gl.uniform2fv(scaleLocation, scale);

    // Draw the rectangle.
    gl.drawArrays(gl.TRIANGLES, 0, 18);
  }
</pre>

And now we have scale. Drag the sliders.

One thing to notice is that scaling by a negative value flips our geometry.

I hope these last 3 posts were helpful in understanding <a href="webgl-2d-translation.html">translation</a>, <a href="webgl-2d-rotation.html">rotation</a> and scale. Next we'll go over <a href="webgl-2d-matrices.html">the magic that is matrices</a> that combine all 3 of these into a much simpler and often more useful form.

<h3>Why an 'F'?</h3>
<p>
The first time I saw someone use an 'F' was on a texture. The 'F' itself is not important. What is important is that you can tell its orientation from any direction. If we used a heart ? or a triangle △ for example we couldn't tell if it was flipped horizontally. A circle ○ would be even worse. A colored rectangle would arguably work with different colors on each corner but then you'd have to remember which corner was which. An F's orientation is instantly recognizable.

Any shape that you can tell the orientation of would work, I've just used 'F' ever since I was 'F'irst introduced to the idea.
