Title: WebGL - Scene Graph
Description: What a scene graph is want what it's used for

This article is a continuation of [previous WebGL
articles](webgl-fundamentals.html).  The previous article was about
[drawing multiple things](webgl-drawing-multiple-things.html).  If you
haven't read them I suggest you start there.

I'm sure some CS guru or graphics guru is going to give me an ear full but
...  A scene graph is usually a tree structure where each node in the tree
generates a matrix...  hmmm, that's not a very useful definition.  Maybe
some examples would be useful.

Most 3D engines use a scene graph.  You put the things you want to appear
in the scene graph.  The engine then walks the scene graph and figures out
a list of things to draw.  Scene graphs are hierarchical so for example if
you wanted to make a universe simulation you might have a graph that looks
like this

{{{diagram url="resources/planet-diagram.html" height="500" }}}

What's the point of a scene graph?  The #1 feature of a scene graph is it
provides a parent child relationship for matrices as [we discussed in 2D
matrix math](webgl-2d-matrices.html).  So for example in a simple (but
unrealistic) universe simulation the stars (children), move along with
their galaxy (parent).  Similary a moon (child) moves along with its
planet (parent).  If you move the earth the moon will move with it.  If
you move a galaxy all the stars inside will move with it.  Drag the names
in the diagram above and hopefully you can see their relationships.

If you go back to the [2D matrix math](webgl-2d-matrices.html) you might
remember we multiply lots of matrices in order to translate, rotate, and
scale objects.  A scene graph provides a structure to help decide what
matrix math to apply to an object.

Typically each `Node` in a scene graph represents a *local space*.  Given
the correct matrix math anything in that *local space* can ignore
everything above it.  Another way to state the same thing is that the moon
only has to care about orbiting the earth.  It does not have to care about
orbiting the sun.  Without this scene graph structure you'd have to do
much more complex math to compute how to get the moon to orbit the sun
because its orbit around the sun looks something like this

{{{diagram url="resources/moon-orbit.html" }}}

With a scene graph you just make the moon a child of the earth and then
orbit the earth which is simple.  The scene graph takes care of the fact
that the earth is orbiting the sun.  It does this by walking the nodes and
multiplying the matrices as it walks

    worldMatrix = greatGrandParent * grandParent * parent * self(localMatrix)

In concrete terms our universe simulation that would be

    worldMatrixForMoon = galaxyMatrix * starMatrix * planetMatrix * moonMatrix;

We can do this very simply with a recursive function which is effectively

    function computeWorldMatrix(currentNode, parentWorldMatrix) {
        // compute our world matrix by multplying our local matrix with
        // our parent's world matrix.
        var worldMatrix = m4.multiply(parentWorldMatrix, currentNode.localMatrix);

        // now do the same for all of our children
        currentNode.children.forEach(function(child) {
            computeWorldMatrix(child, worldMatrix);
        });
    }

This brings up some terminology which is pretty common to 3D scene graphs.

*   `localMatrix`: The local matrix for the current node. It transforms
    it and its children in local space with itself at the origin.

*    `worldMatrix`: For a given node it takes stuff in the local space of
     that node and transforms it to the space of the root node of the
     scene graph. Or in other words it places it in the world. If we
     compute the worldMatrix for the moon we'll get that funky orbit you
     see above.

A scene graph is pretty easy to make. Let's define a simple `Node` object.
There's a zillion ways to organize a scene graph and I'm not sure which
way is best. The most common is to have an optional field of thing to draw

    var node = {
       localMatrix: ...,  // the "local" matrix for this node
       worldMatrix: ...,  // the "world" matrix for this node
       children: [],      // array of children
       thingToDraw: ??,   // thing to draw at this node
    };

Let's make a solar system scene graph.  I'm not going to use fancy
textures or anything like that as it would clutter the example.  First
let's make a few functions to help manage nodes.  First we'll make a node
class

    var Node = function() {
      this.children = [];
      this.localMatrix = m4.identity();
      this.worldMatrix = m4.identity();
    };

Let's give it a way to set the parent of a node.

    Node.prototype.setParent = function(parent) {
      // remove us from our parent
      if (this.parent) {
        var ndx = this.parent.children.indexOf(this);
        if (ndx >= 0) {
          this.parent.children.splice(ndx, 1);
        }
      }

      // Add us to our new parent
      if (parent) {
        parent.children.append(this);
      }
      this.parent = parent;
    };

And here's the code to compute world matrices from local matrices based on
their parent-child relationships.  If we start at the parent and
recursively visit the children we can compute their world matrices.  If
you don't understand matrix math [check out this article on
them](webgl-2d-matrices.html).

    Node.prototype.updateWorldMatrix = function(parentWorldMatrix) {
      if (parentWorldMatrix) {
        // a matrix was passed in so do the math and
        // store the result in `this.worldMatrix`.
        m4.multiply(this.localMatrix, parentWorldMatrix, this.worldMatrix);
      } else {
        // no matrix was passed in so just copy localMatrix to worldMatrix
        m4.copy(this.localMatrix, this.worldMatrix);
      }

      // now process all the children
      var worldMatrix = this.worldMatrix;
      this.children.forEach(function(child) {
        child.updateWorldMatrix(worldMatrix);
      });
    };

Let's just do the sun, the earth, and the moon to keep it simple.  We'll
of course use fake distances so things fit on the screen.  We'll just use
a single sphere model and color it yellowish for the sun, blue-greenish
for the earth and grayish for the moon.  If `drawInfo`, `bufferInfo`, and
`programInfo` are not familiar to you [see the previous
article](webgl-drawing-multiple-things.html).

    // Let's make all the nodes
    var sunNode = new Node();
    sunNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(0, 0, 0);  // sun at the center
    sunNode.drawInfo = {
      uniforms: {
        u_colorOffset: [0.6, 0.6, 0, 1], // yellow
        u_colorMult:   [0.4, 0.4, 0, 1],
      },
      programInfo: programInfo,
      bufferInfo: sphereBufferInfo,
    };

    var earthNode = new Node();
    earthNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(100, 0, 0);  // earth 100 units from the sun
    earthNode.drawInfo = {
      uniforms: {
        u_colorOffset: [0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1],  // blue-green
        u_colorMult:   [0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 1],
      },
      programInfo: programInfo,
      bufferInfo: sphereBufferInfo,
    };

    var moonNode = new Node();
    moonNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(20, 0, 0);  // moon 20 units from the earth
    moonNode.drawInfo = {
      uniforms: {
        u_colorOffset: [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 1],  // gray
        u_colorMult:   [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1],
      },
      programInfo: programInfo,
      bufferInfo: sphereBufferInfo,
    };

Now that we've made the nodes let's connect them.

    // connect the celestial objects
    moonNode.setParent(earthNode);
    earthNode.setParent(sunNode);

We'll again make a list of objects and a list of objects to draw.

    var objects = [
      sunNode,
      earthNode,
      moonNode,
    ];

    var objectsToDraw = [
      sunNode.drawInfo,
      earthNode.drawInfo,
      moonNode.drawInfo,
    ];

At render time we'll update each object's local matrix by rotating it
slightly.

    // update the local matrices for each object.
    m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), sunNode.localMatrix  , sunNode.localMatrix);
    m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), earthNode.localMatrix, earthNode.localMatrix);
    m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), moonNode.localMatrix , moonNode.localMatrix);

Now that the local matrices are updated we'll update all the world
matrices

    sunNode.updateWorldMatrix();

Finally now that we have world matrices we need to multiply those to get a
[worldViewProjection matrix](webgl-3d-perspective.html) for each object.

    // Compute all the matrices for rendering
    objects.forEach(function(object) {
      object.drawInfo.uniforms.u_matrix = m4.multiply(viewProjectionMatrix, object.worldMatrix);
    });

Rendering is [the same loop we saw in our last
article](webgl-drawing-multiple-things.html).

{{{example url="../webgl-scene-graph-solar-system.html" }}}

You'll notice all of the planets are the same size.  Let's try to make the
earth larger

    // earth 100 units from the sun
    earthNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(100, 0, 0);
    // make the earth twice as large
    earthNode.localMatrix = m4.scale(earthNode.localMatrix, 2, 2, 2);

{{{example url="../webgl-scene-graph-solar-system-larger-earth.html" }}}

Oops.  The moon got larger too.  To fix this we could manually shrink the
moon.  A better solution though is to add more nodes to our scene graph.
Instead of just

      sun
       |
      earth
       |
      moon

We'll change it to

     solarSystem
       |    |
       |   sun
       |
     earthOrbit
       |    |
       |  earth
       |
      moonOrbit
          |
         moon

This will let the earth rotate around the solarSystem but we can
separately rotate and scale the sun and it won't affect the earth.
Similarly the earth can rotate separately from the moon.  Let's make more
nodes for `solarSystem`, `earthOrbit` and `moonOrbit`.

    var solarSystemNode = new Node();
    var earthOrbitNode = new Node();
    earthOrbitNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(100, 0, 0);  // earth orbit 100 units from the sun
    var moonOrbitNode = new Node();
    moonOrbitNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(20, 0, 0);  // moon 20 units from the earth

Those orbit distances have been removed from the old nodes

    var earthNode = new Node();
    -// earth 100 units from the sun
    -earthNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(100, 0, 0);
    -// make the earth twice as large
    -earthNode.localMatrix = m4.scale(earthNode.localMatrix, 2, 2, 2);
    +earthNode.localMatrix = m4.scaling(2, 2, 2);   // make the earth twice as large

    var moonNode = new Node();
    -moonNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(20, 0, 0);  // moon 20 units from the earth

Connecting them now looks like this

    // connect the celetial objects
    sunNode.setParent(solarSystemNode);
    earthOrbitNode.setParent(solarSystemNode);
    earthNode.setParent(earthOrbitNode);
    moonOrbitNode.setParent(earthOrbitNode);
    moonNode.setParent(moonOrbitNode);

And we only need to update the orbits

    // update the local matrices for each object.
    -m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), sunNode.localMatrix  , sunNode.localMatrix);
    -m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), earthNode.localMatrix, earthNode.localMatrix);
    -m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), moonNode.localMatrix , moonNode.localMatrix);
    +m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), earthOrbitNode.localMatrix, earthOrbitNode.localMatrix);
    +m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.01), moonOrbitNode.localMatrix, moonOrbitNode.localMatrix);

    // Update all world matrices in the scene graph
    -sunNode.updateWorldMatrix();
    +solarSystemNode.updateWorldMatrix();

And now you can see the earth is double size, the moon is not.

{{{example url="../webgl-scene-graph-solar-system-larger-earth-fixed.html" }}}

You might also notice the sun and the earth are no longer rotating in place. That is now independent.

Let's adjust a few more things.

    -sunNode.localMatrix = m4.translation(0, 0, 0);  // sun at the center
    +sunNode.localMatrix = m4.scaling(5, 5, 5);

    ...

    +moonNode.localMatrix = m4.scaling(0.4, 0.4, 0.4);

    ...
    // update the local matrices for each object.
    matrixMultiply(earthOrbitNode.localMatrix, m4.yRotation(0.01), earthOrbitNode.localMatrix);
    matrixMultiply(moonOrbitNode.localMatrix, m4.yRotation(0.01), moonOrbitNode.localMatrix);
    +// spin the earth
    +m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(0.05), earthNode.localMatrix, earthNode.localMatrix);
    +// spin the moon
    +m4.multiply(m4.yRotation(-0.01), moonNode.localMatrix, moonNode.localMatrix);

{{{example url="../webgl-scene-graph-solar-system-adjusted.html" }}}

Currently we have a `localMatrix` and we're modifying it each frame.
There's a problem though in that every frame our math will collect a
little bit of error.  There is a way to fix the math which is called
*ortho normalizing a matrix* but even that won't always work.  For example
let's imagine we scaled down zero and back.  Let's just do that for one
value `x`

    x = 246;       // frame #0, x = 246

    scale = 1;
    x = x * scale  // frame #1, x = 246

    scale = 0.5;
    x = x * scale  // frame #2, x = 123

    scale = 0;
    x = x * scale  // frame #3, x = 0

    scale = 0.5;
    x = x * scale  // frame #4, x = 0  OOPS!

    scale = 1;
    x = x * scale  // frame #5, x = 0  OOPS!

We lost our value. We can fix this by adding some other class that updates the matrix from
other values. Let's change the `Node` definition to have a `source`. If it exists we'll
ask the `source` to give us a local matrix.

    *var Node = function(source) {
      this.children = [];
      this.localMatrix = m4.identity();
      this.worldMatrix = m4.identity();
    +  this.source = source;
    };

    Node.prototype.updateWorldMatrix = function(matrix) {

    +  var source = this.source;
    +  if (source) {
    +    source.getMatrix(this.localMatrix);
    +  }

      ...

Now we can create a source. A common source is one that provides translation, rotation, and scale
something like this

    var TRS = function() {
      this.translation = [0, 0, 0];
      this.rotation = [0, 0, 0];
      this.scale = [1, 1, 1];
    };

    TRS.prototype.getMatrix = function(dst) {
      dst = dst || new Float32Array(16);
      var t = this.translation;
      var r = this.rotation;
      var s = this.scale;

      // compute a matrix from translation, rotation, and scale
      m4.translation(t[0], t[1], t[2], dst);
      matrixMultiply(m4.xRotation(r[0]), dst, dst);
      matrixMultiply(m4.yRotation(r[1]), dst, dst);
      matrixMultiply(m4.zRotation(r[2]), dst, dst);
      matrixMultiply(m4.scaling(s[0], s[1], s[2]), dst, dst);
      return dst;
    };

And we can use it like this

    // at init time making a node with a source
    var someTRS  = new TRS();
    var someNode = new Node(someTRS);

    // at render time
    someTRS.rotation[2] += elapsedTime;

Now there's no issue because we are recreating the matrix each time.

You might be thinking, I'm not making a solar system so what's the point?
Well, If you wanted to animate a human you might have a scene graph that
looks like this

{{{diagram url="resources/person-diagram.html" height="400" }}}

How many joints you add for fingers and toes is up to you.  The more
joints you have the more power it takes to compute the animations and the
more animation data it takes to provide info for all the joints.  Old
games like Virtua Fighter had around 15 joints.  Games in the early to mid
2000s had 30 to 70 joints.  If you did every joint in your hands there's
at least 20 in each hand so just 2 hands is 40 joints.  Many games that
want to animate hands animate the thumb as one and the 4 fingers as one
large finger to save on time (both CPU/GPU and artist time) and memory.

In any case here's a block guy I hacked together.  It's using the `TRS`
source for each node mentioned above.  Programmer art and programmer
animation FTW!  :P

{{{example url="../webgl-scene-graph-block-guy.html" }}}

If you look at pretty much any 3D library you'll find a scene graph
similar to this.

<div class="webgl_bottombar">
<h3>SetParent vs AddChild / RemoveChild</h3>
<p>Many scene graphs have a <code>node.addChild</code> function and a <code>node.removeChild</code>
function whereas above I made a <code>node.setParent</code> function. Which way is better
is arguably a matter of style but I'd argue one objectively better reason
<code>setParent</code> is better than <code>addChild</code> is because it makes code like
this impossible.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    someParent.addChild(someNode);
    ...
    someOtherParent.addChild(someNode);
</pre>
<p>What does that mean? Does <code>someNode</code> get added to both <code>someParent</code> and <code>someOtherParent</code>?
In most scene graphs that's impossible. Does the second call generate an error?
<code>ERROR: Already have parent</code>. Does it magically remove <code>someNode</code> from <code>someParent</code> before
adding it to <code>someOtherParent</code>? If it does it's certainly not clear from the name <code>addChild</code>.
</p>
<p><code>setParent</code> on the other hand has no such issue</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
    someNode.setParent(someParent);
    ...
    someNode.setParent(someOtherParent);
</pre>
<p>
It's 100% obvious what's happening in this case. Zero ambiguity.
</p>
