Title: WebGL 3D - Spot Lighting
Description: How to implement spot lights in WebGL

This article is a continuation of [WebGL 3D Point
Lighting](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html).  If you haven't read that I
suggest [you start there](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html).

In the last article we covered point lighting where for every point
on the surface of our object we compute the direction from the light
to that point on the surface. We then do the same thing we did for
[directional lighting](webgl-3d-lighting-directional.html) which is
we took the dot product of the surface normal (the direction the surface
is facing) and the light direction. This gave us a value of
1 if the two directions matched and should therefore be fully lit. 0 if
the two directions were perpendicular and -1 if they were opposite.
We used that value directly to multiply the color of the surface
which gave us lighting.

Spot lighting is only a very small change. In fact if you think
creatively about the stuff we've done so far you might be able
to derive your own solution.

You can imagine a point light as a point with light going in all
directions from that point.
To make a spot light all we need to do is choose a direction from
that point, this is the direction of our spotlight. Then, for every
direction the light is going we could take the dot product of
that direction with our chosen spotlight direction. We'd pick some arbitary
limit and decide if we're within that limit we light. If we're not within
that limit we don't light.

{{{diagram url="resources/spot-lighting.html" width="500" height="400" className="noborder" }}}

In the diagram above we can see a light with rays going in all directions and
printed on them is their dot product relative to the direction.
We then have a specific **direction** that is the direction of the spotlight.
We choose a limit (above it's in degrees). From the limit we compute a *dot limit*,
we just take the cosine of the limit. If the dot product of our chosen direction of the spotlight to
the direction of each ray of light is above the dot limit then we do the lighting. Otherwise no lighting.

To say this another way, let's say the limit is 20 degrees. We can convert
that to radians and from that to a value for -1 to 1 by taking the cosine. Let's call that dot space.
In other words here's a small table for limit values

              limits in
     degrees | radians | dot space
     --------+---------+----------
        0    |   0.0   |    1.0
        22   |    .38  |     .93
        45   |    .79  |     .71
        67   |   1.17  |     .39
        90   |   1.57  |    0.0
       180   |   3.14  |   -1.0

Then we can the just check

    dotFromDirection = dot(surfaceToLight, -lightDirection)
    if (dotFromDirection >= limitInDotSpace) {
       // do the lighting
    }

Let's do that

First let's modify our fragment shader from
[the last article](webgl-3d-lighting-point.html).

```
precision mediump float;

// Passed in from the vertex shader.
varying vec3 v_normal;
varying vec3 v_surfaceToLight;
varying vec3 v_surfaceToView;

uniform vec4 u_color;
uniform float u_shininess;
+uniform vec3 u_lightDirection;
+uniform float u_limit;          // in dot space

void main() {
  // because v_normal is a varying it's interpolated,
  // it will not be a uint vector. Normalizing it
  // will make it a unit vector again
  vec3 normal = normalize(v_normal);

  vec3 surfaceToLightDirection = normalize(v_surfaceToLight);
  vec3 surfaceToViewDirection = normalize(v_surfaceToView);
  vec3 halfVector = normalize(surfaceToLightDirection + surfaceToViewDirection);

-  float light = dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);
+  float light = 0.0;
  float specular = 0.0;

+  float dotFromDirection = dot(surfaceToLightDirection,
+                               -u_lightDirection);
+  if (dotFromDirection >= u_limit) {
*    light = dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);
*    if (light > 0.0) {
*      specular = pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess);
*    }
+  }

  gl_FragColor = u_color;

  // Lets multiply just the color portion (not the alpha)
  // by the light
  gl_FragColor.rgb *= light;

  // Just add in the specular
  gl_FragColor.rgb += specular;
}
```

Of course we need to look up the locations of the uniforms we
just added.

```
  var lightDirection = [?, ?, ?];
  var limit = degToRad(20);

  ...

  var lightDirectionLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_lightDirection");
  var limitLocation = gl.getUniformLocation(program, "u_limit");
```

and we need to set them

```
    gl.uniform3fv(lightDirectionLocation, lightDirection);
    gl.uniform1f(limitLocation, Math.cos(limit));
```

And here it is

{{{example url="../webgl-3d-lighting-spot.html" }}}

A few things to note: One is we're negating `u_lightDirection` above.
That's a [*six of one, half dozen of another*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/six_of_one,_half_a_dozen_of_the_other)
type of thing. We want the 2 directions we're comparing to point in
the same direction when they match. That means we need to compare
the surfaceToLightDirection to the opposite of the spotlight direction.
We could do this in many different ways. We could pass the negative
direction when setting the uniform. This would be my 1st choice
but I thought it would be less confusing to call the uniform `u_lightDirection` instead of `u_reverseLightDirection` or `u_negativeLightDirection`

Another thing, and maybe this is just a personal preference, I don't
like to use conditionals in shaders if possible. I think the reason
is it used to be that shaders didn't actually have conditionals. If you added
a conditional the shader compiler would expand the code with lots
of multiply by 0 and 1 here and there to make it so there were not
any actual conditionals in the code. That meant adding conditionals
could make your code explode into combinitorial expansions. I'm not
sure that's true anymore but let's get rid of the conditionals anyway
just to show some techniques. You can decide yourself whether or not
to use them.

There is a GLSL function called `step`. It takes 2 values and if the
second value is greater than or equal the first it returns 1.0. Otherwise it returns 0. You could write it like this in JavaScript

    function step(a, b) {
       if (b >= a) {
           return 1;
       } else {
           return 0;
       }
    }

Let's use `step` to get rid of the conditions

```
  float dotFromDirection = dot(surfaceToLightDirection,
                               -u_lightDirection);
  // inLight will be 1 if we're inside the spotlight and 0 if not
  float inLight = step(u_limit, dotFromDirection);
  float light = inLight * dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);
  float specular = inLight * pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess);
```

Nothing changes visually but here is that

{{{example url="../webgl-3d-lighting-spot-using-step.html" }}}

One other thing is right now the spotlight is super harsh. We're
either inside the spotlight or not and things just turn black.

To fix this we could use 2 limits instead of one,
an inner limit and an outer limit.
If we're inside the inner limit then use 1.0. If we're outside the outer
limit then use 0.0. If we're between the inner limit and the outer limit
then lerp between 1.0 and 0.0.

Here's one way we could do this

```
-uniform float u_limit;          // in dot space
+uniform float u_innerLimit;     // in dot space
+uniform float u_outerLimit;     // in dot space

...

  float dotFromDirection = dot(surfaceToLightDirection,
                               -u_lightDirection);
-  float inLight = step(u_limit, dotFromDirection);
+  float limitRange = u_innerLimit - u_outerLimit;
+  float inLight = clamp((dotFromDirection - u_outerLimit) / limitRange, 0.0, 1.0);
  float light = inLight * dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);
  float specular = inLight * pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess);

```

And that works

{{{example url="../webgl-3d-lighting-spot-falloff.html" }}}

Now we're getting something that looks more like a spotlight!

One thing to be aware of is if `u_innerLimit` is equal to `u_outerLimit`
then `limitRange` will be 0.0. We divide by `limitRange` and dividing by
zero is bad/undefined. There's nothing to do in the shader here we just
need to make sure in our JavaScript that `u_innerLimit` is never equal to
`u_outerLimit`. (note: the example code does not do this).

GLSL also has a function we could use to slightly simplify this. It's
called `smoothstep` and like `step` it returns a value from 0 to 1 but
it takes both an lower and upper bound and lerps between 0 and 1 between
those bounds.

     smoothstep(lowerBound, upperBound, value)

Let's do that

```
  float dotFromDirection = dot(surfaceToLightDirection,
                               -u_lightDirection);
-  float limitRange = u_innerLimit - u_outerLimit;
-  float inLight = clamp((dotFromDirection - u_outerLimit) / limitRange, 0.0, 1.0);
  float inLight = smoothstep(u_outerLimit, u_innerLimit, dotFromDirection);
  float light = inLight * dot(normal, surfaceToLightDirection);
  float specular = inLight * pow(dot(normal, halfVector), u_shininess);
```

That works too

{{{example url="../webgl-3d-lighting-spot-falloff-using-smoothstep.html" }}}

The difference is `smoothstep` uses a Hermite interpolation instead of a
linear interpolation. That means between `lowerBound` and `upperBound`
it intepolates like the image below on the right whereas a linear interpolation is like the image on the left.

<img class="webgl_center" src="resources/linear-vs-hermite.png" />

It's up to you if you think the difference matters.

One other thing to be aware is the `smoothstep` function has undefined
results if the `lowerBound` is greater than or equal to `upperBound`. Having
them be equal is the same issue we had above. The added issue of not being
defined if `lowerBound` is greater than `upperBound` is new but for the
purpose of a spotlight that should never be true.
