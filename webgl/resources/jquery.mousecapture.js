 * version 1.1
 * by Sander Dieleman <sanderdieleman at gmail dot com>
 * A simple mouse capturing plugin for jQuery.

 *
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 * $( ... ).mousecapture({
 *     "down": function(event, sharedData) { ... },
 *     "move": function(event, sharedData) { ... },
 *     "up": function(event, sharedData) { ... }
 * });
 *
 * "down", "move" and "up" are the handlers for the mousedown, mousemove and
 * mouseup events respectively. Only "down" is required.
 *
 * The unmodified event object is passed to the handlers (event), as well as
 * a blank slate object (sharedData) which can be used to store data that
 * needs to be shared between the handlers. Alternatively, shared variables
 * can be declared before the mousecapture call.
 *
 * Inside the handlers, "this" refers to the target element, just like when
 * jQuery's regular mouse events would be used.
 *
 *
 * DEMO
 *
 * A demo is available at:
 * http://benanne.net/misc/jquery-plugins/mousecapture/demo.html
 *
 *
 * MORE INFORMATION
 *
 * Read http://benanne.net/code/?p=238 for more information.
 *
 *
 * CHANGES
 *
 * v1.2
 * - the context in which the down and up handlers are executed should be
 *   "$this", not "target".
 * - moved some code around to make it smaller: it doesn't matter wether
 *   the handlers are attached / unattached before or after the actual
 *   handler is executed. At least I think it doesn't.
 *
 * v1.1
 * - added "return this" to the mousecapture method, so it conforms to the
 *   jQuery plugin authoring guidelines.
 *
 * v1.0
 * - first version
 *
